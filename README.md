# Strapi with React and Apollo Server

This app was made with Strapi, React, Apollo, GraphQL and more to be able to solve the problem of agreeing on something to eat. You and your signficant other login to the app and start swiping on restaurants. After a few likes, hit the matches page and see which restaurants you both agreed on. Then decide on which one sounds best. 

To fire this application up, go to both the client and public folder and run 'npm install'. Then from a terminal instance pointed to the client run 'npm start', and cd into the backend and run 'npm run develop'.
